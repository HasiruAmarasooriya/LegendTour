                    Thomas Bjørn claimed his maiden Legends Tour title with a birdie on the second play-off hole after finishing tied with Welshman Phillip Price

                    The Dane posted a closing six under par round of 65 to join Price on 15 under par, and the duo both made par on the first trip back down the par five 18th hole at Rosapenna Hotel & Golf Resort. On the second play-off hole, Price saw his birdie putt lip-out leaving Bjørn with a five-foot putt for the win, which he duly converted.

                    After securing his first success for eight years, Bjørn gladly welcomed back some familiar feelings when he realised he had a chance to win at Rosapenna.

                    “It was nice,” he said. “It never gets old, that feeling that you lose it for a few years when you go through the motions on the European Tour and you don’t really get in contention and once you get in there, all those old feelings come up in you.

                    As a sportsman, there’s no greater feeling than Sunday afternoon. It doesn’t really matter where it is, I really got into it today. I recognised myself and I haven’t seen that person for quite a while, which is quite nice. It’s pretty special winning any golf tournament.”

                    Bjørn and Price finished six strokes clear of their nearest competitors, with English duo Peter Baker and Peter Wilson sharing third place with Argentina’s Mauricio Molina, who set a new course record on the Old Tom Morris Links with a sublime nine under par round of 62.
