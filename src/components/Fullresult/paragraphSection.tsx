                    Chris Williams fought off the challenge of Major Champions and former Ryder Cup stars to secure a three-stroke victory at the Farmfoods European Legends Links Championship at Trevose Golf & Country Club. The 62-year-old’s victory on the Cornish coastline is his first in Europe in a career spanning over 40 years and he therefore rates it as his most impressive triumph.
