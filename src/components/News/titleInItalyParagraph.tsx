                    Thomas Gögele edged an exciting final day battle with Bradley Dredge to lift the trophy at San Domenico with a brilliant three-round total of -19 after scores of 64, 66 and 67.         </p>

                <p className="text-[15px] lg:text-[18px] text-[#232323] mb-[15px] md:mb-[26px] font-brown-bold">
                    The eventual winner had a one-shot advantage over Dredge heading into the final 18 holes and it quickly became a two-horse race as Gögele made two birdies and the Welshman picked up three in the first six holes to be locked together on -16.
                </p>

                <p className="text-[15px] lg:text-[18px] text-[#232323] mb-[15px] md:mb-[26px] font-brown-bold">
                    Both players birdied the 8th and 10th holes, but they were finally separated when Dredge dropped a shot on the 14th. Gögele doubled his lead to two shots with a birdie at the par-5 16th and Dredge’s three-putt bogey from long range at the par-3 17th gave him a much more comfortable three-shot advantage going up the final hole. Gögele made a brilliant up-and-down to go bogey-free over the last two rounds and complete a three-shot win.                </p>
                <p className="text-[15px] lg:text-[18px] text-[#232323] mb-[15px] md:mb-[26px] font-brown-bold">Dredge, who won the European Legends Cup last season, signed for a 69 to finish alone in 2nd on -16 and climb to 13th on the MCB Road to Mauritius.</p>
                <p className="text-[15px] lg:text-[18px] text-[#232323] mb-[15px] md:mb-[26px] font-brown-bold">Gögele had been showing signs of a breakthrough victory with consistently strong performances all year, and this week completes an excellent run of form that featured three top-15s following a tied-3rd in the HSBC India Legends Championship.</p>

                    “It’s amazing,” said the champion, who rises to 9th on the MCB Road to Mauritius. “I’ve seen a few people who have their first win and said they can’t really say what it means to them – and I can’t really say what it means to me now. I’ve worked really hard the whole day. I wouldn’t say I played as good as the last two days, but I didn’t make any mistakes. It was a close battle with Bradley, he’s a very, very good player. I got out on top, and that’s fantastic.          </p>

                <p className="text-[15px] lg:text-[18px] text-[#232323] mb-[15px] md:mb-[26px] font-brown-bold">“We had an interview at the beginning of the year in Barbados, and I said I was working on the right things. A lot of things I did well then, and I’ve improved on them since. I’m really proud that I was able to do them so well. It was good the last few weeks, and this week I really did them even better. It shows me that I’m able to win, that I can win with a low score and that the things I’m working on are the right things.”</p>
                <p className="text-[15px] lg:text-[18px] text-[#232323] mb-[15px] md:mb-[26px] font-brown-bold">It was even more special as he had his wife Nicole caddying for him: “It’s absolutely outstanding. I love it. I love it when she comes with me. It’s a great week for us. I pretty much always play well when she’s on the bag, so it was due that I win one with her. It’s a great moment for us.”

                    Andrew Marshall and Simon Griffiths were tied-3rd on -14. Marshall flew up the leaderboard with eight birdies in his first 14 holes, but finished with three pars and a bogey at the last in an excellent 65. Griffiths, playing in the final group alongside the top two, made a vital birdie on the 18th and signed for a 67.             </p>

                    Steven Richardson’s 64 was the best round of the day and saw the former Ryder Cup player finish in tied-5thalongside Brian Davis. Davis, who’s a five-time runner-up on the PGA Tour, closed out his week with three birdies in the last four holes to shoot 66.             </p>

                    Greg Owen was 7th on -12, with David Shacklady and top Italian Emanuele Canonica a shot further back. There was a six-way tie for 10th, including a couple of winners this season, Joakim Haeggman and Clark Dennis.    </p>
